			<p>I designed and created a multi-sensory environment for the Maryland State Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in downtown Baltimore. Addressing the senses of touch, sound, and vision, my installation enables both sighted and visually impaired users to experience design.</p> <br />

			<p>I interviewed numerous patrons of the library, both blind and low-sighted, to learn how people compensate for vision loss. Only ten percent of blind adults are able to read braille; furthermore, braille is often not taught to blind children because it is seen as a difficult language to grasp. However, promoting braille helps expand literacy among the blind.</p> <br />

			<p>Together with the library staff, I sought to create an environment in which both children and parents can learn braille—in a fun and easy way—while simultaneously engaging the different senses. I utilized strong contrasting colors—yellow/blue and white/black—colors that are seen by low vision people.</p>  <br />

			<p>Please visit my permanent installation at the Maryland State Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, located at 415 Park Avenue in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
